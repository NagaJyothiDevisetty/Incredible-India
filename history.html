<h5>India is a country in South Asia whose name comes from the Indus River.
The name 'Bharata'is used as a designation for the country in their 
constitutionreferencing the ancient mythological emperor, Bharata,
whose story is told, in part, in the Indian epic Mahabharata.
According to the writings known as the Puranas (religious/historical texts written down in the 5th century CE), 
Bharata conquered the whole subcontinent of India and ruled the land in peace and harmony.
The land was, therefore,known as Bharatavarsha and it is called as one of the oldest inhabited regions on the planet.</h5>

<h3>Ancient History</h3><h5>Indian history is divided into three different parts - Ancient Indian history,Medieval Indian history and Modern Indian history.
The ancient people of India have a continuous civilization since the pre historic age of 40001 BC, 
when the first people of the World began to live. Most probably the first people came to India from Africa. 
They initially gathered in the northern part of India and hunting was their only profession. 
But after a long time in 4000 BC, they moved to the Indus river valley and took farming as their main profession.
After that in 2500 BC, they began to live a better life and made a number of beautiful cities and houses.
There were two main cities; Harappa and Mohenjodaro. Both cities are now in Pakistan.
The people of these cities lived in stone houses two and they used bronze tools.
The Harappa people used an early form of writing based on hieroglyphs, like the Egyptians.
By around 2000 BC, the Harappan civilization had collapsed.</h4>
<h3>Medieval History</h3>
<h5>
The fifth century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism,
and it is in his reign that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. 
In the eighth century Islam came to India for the first time and by the eleventh
century had firmly established itself in India as a political force.
It resulted into the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire, 
under which India once again achieved a large measure of political unity. </h5>

<p>Mahatma Gandhi Father of the Nation is also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He was born on 2 October,1869
Porbandar, Gujarat, India. Gandhi ji got married to the Kasturba Makhanji at the age of just 13 years.
He had played an important role in India's freedom struggle.
Let us read his major movements that helped in achieving freedom from British Raj.
Mahatma Gandhi was known for his non-violence protest and was a leading figure of freedom movements whether in India
or South Africa. With his efforts finally India got freedom from the colonial rule. He always gave importance to human rights.
 Mahatma Gandhi is a true inspiration not only for the past generation but also for the generations to come with his
ideology of non-violence, truth, tolerance and social welfare.
</p>
<p>
Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. 
The honorific Mahatma applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa.
He is also called Bapu in India. He was born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat,
western India and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London.
Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km Dandi Salt March in 1930 
and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community 
and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. Indians widely describe Gandhi as
 the father of the nation. His birthday, 2 October, is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday and world-wide as 
 the International Day of Nonviolence.

</p>
<h4>Major movements of Mahatma Gandhi are as follows:</h4>

<ol>
  <li><p>Champaran Satyagraha (1917):</p> </li>
  <li><p>Khilafat Movement (1919): </p>
  <li><p>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920):</p> </li>

			<p>The British were able to take control of India mainly because India was not united. 
The British signed treaties and made military and trading alliances with many of the independent states that made up India. ... 
These local princes were effective at maintaining British rule and gained much from being loyal to the British.
The British East India Company was established by Queen Elizabeth I in 1600 operate the spice trade between Britain and India. The company established trading centres in Masulipattam,
Surat and Madras and had competition from the French, Dutch and Portuguese, all of whom had trading interests in India.
During the middle of the eighteenth century, the company came to power in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and reached an agreement with the Mughals to collect land revenue
in return for maintaining order. The company expanded its control by defeating Tipu Sultan, the Marathas and by taking over Nepal, Sind, Burma and the Punjab.
The doctrine of lapse was introduced, stipulating that, if the ruler of a state died without a natural heir, the state would automatically come under British rule.
Under this doctrine, the company took over the states of Satara, Nagpur and Jhansi. Oudh also was taken over on the grounds of misgovernance.
</p>
<h4>The mutiny of 1857</h4>
<p>The revolt was caused by heavy taxation, a new land revenue system, activities of Christian missionaries and the dumping of British-made goods on the Indian market. 
Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi and Nana Sahib, who were deposed by the doctrine of lapse, rose in revolt.
On May 10, 1857 soldiers stationed in Meerut mutinied and marched on Delhi to proclaim the Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, as emperor of India.
The revolt was suppressed by the British as the rebels fighting them were poorly co-ordinated and lacked modern arms.
The uprising had the effect of uniting India, creating unity between the many princely states.</p>

<h4>The British Raj</h4>
<p>Britain's policy of one-way free trade ruined Indian industries. India provided raw materials such as cotton and iron ore for production in British factories.
Mass produced commodities made in Britain from these raw materials were then dumped back onto the Indian market at a lower price than locally produced merchandise,
effectively undermining the local economy.
Queen Victoria assumed the title of Empress of India as the British exercised control and influence over the princely Indian states. A policy of divide and rule was 
adopted to stoke tensions between Muslims and Hindus. The aim was to get them to fight amongst themselves rather than unify against the British.
This was also the time of reform and cultural awakening. As educated Indians opened up to modern ideas, Raja Ram Mohan Roy and Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar initiated religious, 
social, educational and political developments. They worked actively towards improving the position of women and ridding Hinduism of irrational distortions and practices.
Spiritual leaders revived Hinduism and urged people to adopt the scientific attitude of the West.</p>
<h4>National congress (1885)</h4>
<p>The British introduced the Ilbert Bill, which gave Indian magistrates the right to try Europeans. Europeans objected strongly and the bill was withdrawn.
The Vernacular Press Act, passed by Lord Lytton imposed severe restrictions on the Indian press, which was nationalistic. 
Nationalistic Indians began to organise themselves and held various meetings across India.
In 1885, the Indian National Congress was formed, holding its first sessions in Bombay. The Congress demanded more power for Indians in the legislative
 council and called for controls on the drain of wealth. The party used petition, prayer and protest as its tools.
</p>
<h4>Indian National Movement</h4>
<p>After about 15 years of petitioning the British government, the nationalists realised that they were not getting anywhere. 
They were working within the law and framework of British rule and found that their attempts to bring about change in this way were futile.
A new crop of leaders - Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilar and Bipin Chandra Pal - came up with the slogan of self-government (swaraj).
They also realised the need to incorporate the masses into their movement and started using popular festivals like Ganesh Utsav (Lord Ganesh festival) to propagate the concept of swaraj.
At the same time, the concept of swadeshi (indigenous) arose. Like swaraj, it became a movement and people began to boycott foreign products.
Revolutionary leaders began campaigns. After a few bomb blasts, assassinations and shoot outs in India and London, these movements died out.

 <h3>Indian Constitution:</h3>
 <h5>Constitution of India is the supreme law in India. A Constitution is a set of rules and regulations guiding the administration of 
a country. The constitution of India is the framework for political principles, procedures and powers of the government.
It is also the longest constitution in the world with 395 articles and 12 schedules. Originally it consisted of 395 Articles
arranged under 22 Parts and 8 Schedules. Today after many amendments, it has 448 Article and 12 schedules and 25 parts. 
(According to 2019) The constitution was written on 26 November 1949, and was made the center of law in 26 January 1950.
India had to face many problems after independence. Rehabilitating the refugees who migrated from Pakistan,
merging the princely states, maintenance of law and order were the major challenges. Sardar Patel successfully achieved 
the merger of the princely states and provinces with the Union of India. Even the challenge of framing a constitution in
order to enable govern the country was also fulfilled.
The recommendations of the Motilal Nehru Committee and the decisions taken by the meeting of National Congress at 
Karachi prepared for the formation of a Constituent Assembly.

In the original, there are four lions, standing back to back, mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures 
in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a bell-shaped lotus.
